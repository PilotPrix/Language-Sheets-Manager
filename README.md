# Language-Sheets-Manager
This is a fail-safe python script where you will feed the spreadsheet exported from Google Translate saved translations to be organized and optimized for exporting to your favorite flashcard app

What this app will do:
- All translations will be sorted from the language you're learning (eg. Chinese) to English
- Different languages will be sorted into their own spreadsheet file (tsv) you'll have the option which ones you want to export
